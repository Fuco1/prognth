;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs provides `prog1', `prog2' and `progn' to group statements and
;; return the value of first, second or last form.  This package
;; extends this notion to allow arbitrary index.  The macro `prognth'
;; takes as a first argument the index of the form whose value is to
;; be returned.  If the index is 1, 2 or greater than length of the
;; body, the standard emacs forms are used.  Otherwise, this
;; translates to (prog1 (progn ... first INDEX forms) rest)

;; Additionally, `progX' for X from 3 to 9 are generated for easier
;; usage.

;;; Code:

(defmacro prognth (index &rest body)
  "Eval first INDEX arguments sequentially, then eval the BODY.
The value of INDEX-th form is returned."
  (declare (indent 1)
           (debug (numberp body)))
  (let ((len (length body))
        (rest body)
        first-n)
    (cond
     ((>= index len)
      `(progn ,@body))
     ((= index 1)
      `(prog1 ,@body))
     ((= index 2)
      `(prog2 ,@body))
     (t
      (while (and (> index 0) rest)
        (push (car rest) first-n)
        (setq rest (cdr rest))
        (setq index (1- index)))
      `(prog1 (progn ,@(nreverse first-n)) ,@rest)))))
